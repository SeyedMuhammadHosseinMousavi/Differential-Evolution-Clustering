# Differential Evolution Clustering
- Differential Evolution Clustering - (7 Jan 2022)
- Here, we are using evolutionary algorithms, in order to perform clustering task. The selected algorithm is Differential Evolution (DE) evolutionary computation as it is faster than others. We are using HTRU2 dataset which is consisted of 17898 samples and 9 features. Features 5 to 8 are used in this code. All 4 selected features combinations are clustered and compared with K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering visually and statistically. You can use your data and define your parameters. 'K' is the number of clusters, 'MaxIt' is number of iterations and 'nPop' is population size which are most important parameters.




- Enjoy the code and wish me luck :)
