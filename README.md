# Differential-Evolution-Clustering
%% Differential Evolution Clustering - (7 Jan 2022)
% Here, we are using evolutionary algorithms, in order to perform
% clustering task. The selected algorithm is Differential Evolution (DE)
% evolutionary computation as it is faster than others. We are using HTRU2
% dataset which is consisted of 17898 samples and 9 features. Features 5 to
% 8 are used in this code. All 4 selected features combinations are
% clustered and compared with K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Model
% (GMM) Clustering visually and statistically. You can use your data and define
% your parameters. 'K' is the number of clusters, 'MaxIt' is number of
% iterations and 'nPop' is population size which are most important
% parameters.

% System is using the following paper as dataset:
